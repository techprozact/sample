Introducing CUBE
Citi Universal Business Enablement

A secure AI-powered knowledge and process intelligence layer connecting People, Platforms, and Processes across Citi’s enterprise ecosystem.

CUBE
Citi Unified Business Engine

A Secure AI-Powered Knowledge & Process Intelligence Platform for Citi

1. Executive Summary

Citi operates at massive scale across technology, operations, risk, compliance, and business functions. While documentation, processes, and tools exist, knowledge is fragmented across multiple platforms such as Jira, Confluence, SharePoint, internal portals, and service catalogs.

Employees frequently face daily friction:

Not knowing which ticket to raise

Not knowing which system owns an application

Not knowing the correct approval workflow

Searching across thousands of documentation pages

Re-routing misfiled requests

Relying on tribal knowledge

CUBE (Citi Unified Business Engine) proposes a secure, internal AI-powered intelligence layer that unifies Citi’s approved knowledge repositories and provides instant, role-aware guidance across people, processes, and platforms.

CUBE does not create new knowledge.
It intelligently navigates what already exists.

2. Problem Statement

Citi has:

Thousands of internal applications

Hundreds of Jira projects

Multiple service portals

Extensive Confluence documentation

Architecture documents stored across locations

Complex change management workflows

Frequent onboarding of new employees

Current challenges:

Knowledge fragmentation across tools

Repetitive internal questions

Incorrect ticket submissions

Process confusion

Manual triage overhead

Slow onboarding

Dependency on SMEs for basic navigation

Duplicate documentation and outdated SOPs

The issue is not lack of documentation.
The issue is lack of intelligent navigation.

3. Proposed Solution: CUBE

CUBE is a secure, role-based AI intelligence engine that sits on top of approved internal repositories and enables employees to:

Ask natural language questions

Receive accurate, contextual guidance

Navigate processes correctly

Identify system ownership

Access relevant architecture

Raise correct requests the first time

CUBE functions as an intelligent enterprise navigator.

4. Core Use Cases
4.1 Intelligent Process Navigation

User asks:
“How do I request Kibana access?”

CUBE provides:

Correct portal link

Required approvals

Step-by-step instructions

Required fields

Sample template

SLA expectations

Common rejection reasons

Impact:

Reduced misrouted tickets

Faster request completion

Lower operational friction

4.2 Smart Ticket Assistant

Before raising a Jira or service request:

CUBE:

Suggests correct project/queue

Recommends issue type

Auto-fills structured template

Suggests similar past tickets

Warns if wrong category selected

Impact:

Reduced ticket bounce rate

Reduced manual triage

Faster resolution cycles

4.3 Application Ownership & Dependency Resolver

User asks:
“Who owns Application XYZ?”

CUBE provides:

Application owner

Support group

Escalation matrix

Slack/Teams channel (if available)

Related systems

Change approval workflow

Impact:

Faster issue escalation

Reduced communication loops

Better operational clarity

4.4 Architecture & Knowledge Discovery

User asks:
“Show architecture for Payments Gateway.”

CUBE:

Retrieves architecture diagrams

Lists dependent systems

Identifies data flows

Highlights criticality level

Links change management guidelines

Impact:

Faster impact assessment

Better release planning

Improved cross-team visibility

4.5 New Joiner Mode

CUBE supports onboarding by:

Explaining acronyms

Clarifying org structure

Providing team responsibilities

Suggesting mandatory training

Guiding first-time request workflows

Impact:

Reduced onboarding time

Reduced dependency on peers

Improved employee experience

4.6 Knowledge Gap Detection

CUBE identifies:

Frequently asked questions with no documented answers

Outdated or conflicting SOPs

Duplicate documentation

Impact:

Continuous documentation improvement

Stronger governance

Reduced compliance risk

5. What CUBE Will Access

CUBE will index and retrieve from:

Approved Confluence spaces

Approved Jira project metadata

Service catalogs

Knowledge Base articles

Architecture documentation

SOP repositories

Internal policy documentation

Application inventory metadata

Access will be:

Role-based

Permission-aware

Identity-integrated

Fully auditable

CUBE does not bypass existing access controls.

If a user does not have access to a document today, CUBE will not expose it.

6. What CUBE Will NOT Access

CUBE will not:

Access or train on customer PII

Access transaction-level banking data

Access confidential regulatory investigations

Access HR personal records

Access live production databases

Expose restricted legal documents

CUBE operates only on approved, documentation-level repositories.

7. Security & Governance Model

Security is foundational.

CUBE will include:

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Identity integration with Citi authentication

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (no raw data training)

Data masking for sensitive fields

Full audit logs of queries

Governance oversight for indexed repositories

Human review for high-risk content

CUBE enhances compliance rather than weakening it.

8. Business Impact

Estimated impact areas:

Productivity Savings
Even a 5–10 minute daily saving per employee results in significant cost efficiency at enterprise scale.

Reduced Ticket Misrouting
Lower operational overhead for support teams.

Faster Issue Resolution
Reduced time to identify ownership and dependencies.

Improved Onboarding
Accelerated ramp-up for new hires.

Reduced Knowledge Silos
Less dependency on tribal knowledge.

Improved Governance
Centralized and auditable knowledge access.

9. Why This Matters to Citi

Citi already manages credit risk, market risk, and operational risk with advanced systems.

However, internal knowledge navigation remains manual and fragmented.

CUBE brings intelligence to internal operations — enabling:

Faster execution

Better governance

Higher employee productivity

Lower operational friction

Enterprise-wide standardization

CUBE is not a chatbot.
It is a foundational intelligence layer for Citi’s operational ecosystem.

10. Implementation Approach (High-Level)

Phase 1:

Index limited approved Confluence + Service Catalog

Pilot with select technology teams

Phase 2:

Expand to Jira metadata

Add ticket routing intelligence

Phase 3:

Expand enterprise-wide

Enable onboarding mode

Add governance analytics

Low-risk, incremental rollout.

11. Why Judges Should Care

CUBE:

Impacts entire organization

Reduces measurable cost

Improves employee experience

Enhances governance

Is technically feasible

Respects security constraints

Builds long-term enterprise capability

This is a scalable platform — not a one-team tool.

----------------------


Quantify the Impact (This Wins Competitions)

Let’s do rough math:

If:

100,000 employees

Save 10 minutes per day

Avg cost per employee $70/hour

10 minutes = ~$12 per day
100,000 employees = $1.2M per day

Even if 10% adoption:
= $120,000 per day
= $30M+ per year productivity gain

Now you're speaking CFO language.
